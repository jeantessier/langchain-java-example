# Gemini Test

Sample application that uses LangChain4J to interface with OpenAI's ChatGPT LLM.

Based on https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples/blob/main/other-examples/src/main/java/HelloWorldExample.java

## To Compile

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

## To Run

Youâ€™ll need an API key.  So just follow the instructions to
[obtain your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
Save it to the `app/src/main/resources/.env` file as the `OPENAI_API_KEY`
environment variable.  You can use `app/src/main/resources/.env.template` as a
guide to structure your `.env` file.

To run against OpenAI's ChatGPT:

```bash
./gradlew run --args="--model openai"
```

To run against Anthropic's Claude:

```bash
./gradlew run --args="--model anthropic"
```
